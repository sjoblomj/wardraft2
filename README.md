# WarDraft II
An editor for archive files from WarCraft I and WarCraft II.

## Purpose
The games WarCraft I and WarCraft II (excluding Battle.net edition) used WAR-archives to store game data such as graphics, sounds, texts, unit stats, AI scripts etc. This is an editor for those archives. The files inside the archive are indexed and referenced by their index number as opposed to by their file name. The archive format supports LZSS compression.
